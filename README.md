 My project is just a simple website for a Hemp business that will market and inform customers about what the hemp company offers. You can access my website from cloning the repository from https://github.com/N8Dely/TOHC <--(link should work) . Find the index.html file open it and in VS code select the go live button which should take you to the homepage of my project on port 5502. The javascript features that I have included in this website are in the drop down navigation menu when the min-width of the viewing window is between 280px-767px. I have also included a dark mode toggle button that applies to all viewing ports that are min-width of 280px or bigger. I have also created a form(sign up page) that should console.log the users inputs and automatically downloaded the data as a .txt file from the console. In this .txt file there should be an array for storing user inputs, along with a word counter, at the top of the .txt file you should find the day, date, time, year, and  even the time zone of the last user inputs. All files are labled respectfully (.html) - Hyper Text Mark Up Language, (.css) - Cascading Styling Sheets (.js) - Javascript
