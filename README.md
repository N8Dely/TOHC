 My project is just a simple website for a Hemp business that will market and inform customers about what the hemp company offers. You can access my website from cloning the repository from https://github.com/N8Dely/TOHC then accessing the index.html file or you can simply follow this link https://n8dely.github.io/TOHC/ . The javascript features that I have included in this website are in the drop down navigation menu when the min-width of the viewing window is between 280px-767px. I have also included a dark mode toggle button that applies to all viewing ports that are min-width of 280px or bigger. One of the CSS features I have included in my website is flexbox which I have implemented on many different elements such as the ipsum filler text, pictures, navigation links, and top fixed logo linked to the home section of the page that adds, removes, and resizes content as the viewing port changes in size (media queries).
